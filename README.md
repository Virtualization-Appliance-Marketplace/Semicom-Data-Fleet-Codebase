# Semicom-Data-Fleet-Codebase
Beverly Boardel-(Semicom-SA-VEC-Certified-Systems-Administrator) This is a work in progress, it is based upon the IoT platform of network-ready cloud applications and "smart cities" that host them. The directives of this campaign are generally to launch a line of "driverless vehicles" (aka: Semicom Data Fleets) that serve as support and developer agents for IoT service providers and the industrial utilities that deliver them. Its a hybrid startup business model merging four existing models: 1) Electronic Courier Services 2) Information Security 3) Software Development 4) Developer Reseller Registrar The scene above is for a marketing promotional campaign for the Muhha! Semicom Server Technician Vehicle; a mid-sized fleet of data utility trucks (DUV) which installs and conducts SoC comforming field tests on IoT gateways and conduits used in residential, institutional and commercial establishments. The data fleets also provide 'server by appointment' services in which developers can schedule batch work and nightly dumps of security sensitive data via a user-friendly interface on their own pc.
